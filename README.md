# JavaScript Practice Problems 🚀

A growing collection of JavaScript problems I've solved as I explore the language. These problems help me understand the fundamentals and build problem-solving skills. 💻✨

## 🏆 Problems Tackled So Far

1. **Check if a Number is a Palindrome**  
   - Problem: Determine if a given number reads the same forward and backward.
   - Key Learning: String manipulation and conditional logic.

2. **Dutch National Flag (DNF) Algorithm**  
   - Problem: Sort an array containing 0s, 1s, and 2s.
   - Key Learning: Efficient sorting algorithms with minimal time complexity.

3. **Check if a Number is Prime**  
   - Problem: Identify whether a number is prime or composite.
   - Key Learning: Loops and modular arithmetic.

4. **Frequency of Characters in a String**  
   - Problem: Count the occurrences of each character in a given string.
   - Key Learning: Using objects as frequency counters.

5. **Strict vs. Abstract Equality Operators**  
   - Problem: Understand the difference between `===` and `==` in JavaScript.
   - Key Learning: Type coercion and best practices for comparisons.
